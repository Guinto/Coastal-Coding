Mr. Fuzane’s passion and calling for teaching began in 1993 where he started working as a high school teacher in Zimbabwe. Three years later he went on to teach in Botswana before migrating from Africa to the USA where he quickly found himself answering yet to another teaching call at the Colton Joint Unified School District while pursuing his MBA in Cyber Security, and a CompTIA Security+ ce.</p>
