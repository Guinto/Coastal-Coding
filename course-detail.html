                        <p>At Coastal Coding we use various teaching methods that cater for different learning skills, namely, visual, musical/auditory, physical/kinaesthetic, combination, solitary, social, logical/mathematical, and verbal. These methods are self explanatory.</p>
                        <p>We follow a healthy mix of a four year college and bootcamp teaching styles in that we do have a hybrid lecture that consists of PowerPoint presentations while simultaneously pausing frequently to type some code. We got rid of those long, non-interactive boring lectures and replaced them with lively and energetic lectures punctuated with hands-on activities after every new concept.</p>

                <p>The next 4 weeks will delve deep into Javascript. This is the only scripting language that is used both in the client and server side.
