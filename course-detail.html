                        <p>At Coastal Coding we use various teaching methods that cater for different learning skills, namely, visual, musical/auditory, physical/kinaesthetic, combination, solitary, social, logical/mathematical, and verbal. These methods are self explanatory.</p>
                        <p>We follow a healthy mix of a four year college and bootcamp teaching styles in that we do have a hybrid lecture that consists of PowerPoint presentations while simultaneously pausing frequently to type some code. We got rid of those long, non-interactive boring lectures and replaced them with lively and energetic lectures punctuated with hands-on activities after every new concept.</p>

                        <p>We offer a series of interlocking courses that are meticulously bundled together to create a full stack web developer. You will begin by getting immersed in HTML5 and CSS3, followed by JavaScript and finally the MAMP (Mac OS X, the operating system; Apache, the web server; MySQL, the database management system; and PHP).</p> 
                        <p>This may sound intimidating but we are surely going to walk you at a comfortable pace that will equip you with the web development skills that are on demand. Needless to say your effort will ultimately determine how high you go after graduating.</p>

                        <p>Never before have we such a vast and deep combination of passion, skill and talent as in our teaching faculty. Starting with the founder who has taught in three different countries and in two continents to some faculty heavily laden with industrial experience and managerial expertise.</p>
                        <p>You will also meet frequently with mentors who work in the industry and also liaise with senior and junior colleagues from the different cohots. There is absolutely no need to look any further unless if the commute is inhibiting for you to enroll in our school. Otherwise this is the right time and the right place for you to transform your life with a new career and higher income. According to glassdoor.com, current web development jobs in the Ventura county pay an average of $87,050 per annum.</p>
