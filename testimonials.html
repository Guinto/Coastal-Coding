                                <p>My name is Christin and I am a former student of Professor Fuzane from his HTML5/CSS3 class at Crafton Hills College.</p>
<p>I have known Fuzane for quite some time now. I was impressed with his passion for teaching. He focuses on one-to-one interaction with his students. Any student can read the textbook and learn about coding but not any teacher can teach. I particularly took this class to further my knowledge of HTML5/CSS3. Fuzane had the students partake in verbal discussions and that helped me retain information.</p> 
    <p>We presented individual and group projects that I often look back for reference. I now assist other students who need help in coding that I remembered from his class. His class encouraged me to broaden my horizons and venture out to JavaScript and even Adobe works. </p>

                                <p>I took professor Fuzane’s HTML5/CSS3 class at Crafton Hills College in the Spring of 2015. Professor Fuzane did a great job at relating what he was teaching us to the real world. I learned how to create and design websites in his class. I felt confident enough from what I learned in professor Fuzane’s class to create a website for the company I work for. </p>
                                <p>Thanks to professor Fuzane I was able to make some money using the coding skills I developed in his class. He also helped me get an internship creating websites for a company in Riverside. To this day when I am struggling through my last year of school, I remember the struggles professor Fuzane shared with me about growing up in Africa and learning to read. His stories of where he started to where he is now is an inspiration to me. I am happy to tell anyone about how helpful professor Fuzane is as a computer teacher and as a real life inspiration. </p>
<p>I wish you the best!

I was one of the fisrt students who took Mr. Fuzane&#39;s class when he started teaching at our community college. At first I was skeptical, fearing that I was gambling with my time and money. On the contrary, Professor Fuzane not only taught me how to design my own Web page, but he also taught me how to apply it to the real world. 
</p>
                                    <p>I learned how to meet the specifications any client requested with his guidance. His patience and experience made learning Web Design fun, and encouraged me to pursue a career in programming and networking.</p>

Professor Fuzane created a class environment that was professional, supportive, and creative. His assignments enabled us to apply what we learned during his class and to take a unique approach on a subject that would normally seem repetitive. 
</p>
                                    <p>He also explained subject matter clearly and was always attentive to the needs of his students. I appreciate having the experience of taking the HTML class with Professor Fuzane, and would take it again if I could.</p>
