                <p>The majority of our students are self-funded while others opt to get a loan through one of our 2 lenders (see <i>Pay Tuition</i>).</p>

                <p>We carefully select students that have a strong passion for success. The old saying goes, “Where there is a will there is a way.” As long as you are intrinsically motivated to learn you will succeed in our bootcamp and you will never regret your time with us.</p>
                <p>The interview will either be in person or a phone screening where you'll be speaking with the <a href="teachers.html">Leadership Team.</a></p>
