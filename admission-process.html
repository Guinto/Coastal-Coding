                <p>The majority of our students are self-funded while others opt to get a loan through one of our two lenders (see <i>Pay Tuition</i>).</p>

                <p>The interview will either be in person or a phone screening where you'll be speaking with the <a href="teachers.html">Leadership Team.</a></p>
